    <h1>Piano and Guitar Layout</h1>
    <p>
        This simple app helps you learn the layout of the piano keyboard and guitar/bass
        fretboard and how they relate to each other.
        Press any piano key or tap a guitar string on any fret and you will see the
        corresponding key/fret on another instrument.
    </p>
    <p>For guitar/bass it also shows where the same note on other strings is located.</p>
    <p>
        Click/tap once to highlight the note and click/tap it again to turn off.
        The same notes have the same color but notes in higher octaves have higher lightness.

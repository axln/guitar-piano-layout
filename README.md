# Piano and Guitar Layout

    
This simple app helps you learn the layout of the piano keyboard and guitar/bass
fretboard and how they relate to each other.
Press any piano key or tap a guitar string on any fret and you will see the
corresponding key/fret on another instrument.

For guitar/bass it also shows where the same note on other strings is located.</p>
   
Click/tap once to highlight the note and click/tap it again to turn off.
The same notes have the same color but notes in higher octaves have higher lightness.
